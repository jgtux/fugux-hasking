# Golang: Go concurrency applied in back-ends
## Introduction

After a long story, I decided to make an article about Go concurrency. Before that, I wanted to do another article about Go back-ends, but I decided to cover both subjects, applying Go concurrency in back-ends.

## Concurrency in a Nutshell
First of all, we need to recall what concurrency is, an essential concept for building efficient and high-performance applications.
Concurrency in computing allows tasks to progress by interleaved execution, improving performance and resource usage of tasks such as I/O operations, daemons, back-ends and more. It's essential, especially in applications that demand fast returns and support multiple users.
Remember, concurrency is different from parallelism. While concurrency manages tasks by interleaved execution, in other words, switching between tasks efficiently, parallelism executes multiple tasks simultaneously, it requires more than one core.

## Goroutines and Channels
Go concurrency is built around goroutines and channels, two features that walk together in Go concurrency.

### Goroutine
Goroutines are lightweight threads managed by the Go runtime. They are lighter than traditional threads, goroutines start with a stack size of ~2KB, which grows dynamically based on its memory usage.
Also, goroutines are managed in the user-space by the Go runtime, they are multiplexed by the Go scheduler onto a smaller number of kernel threads, managed by OS. Go scheduler allows spawning a high number of goroutines with minimal overhead, making it efficient for concurrent programming, specially in applications with high demand for concurrency.

Here is an example:
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func iterateUntil(num int) {
	for i := 0; i < num; i++ {
		time.Sleep(500 * time.Millisecond)
		fmt.Println(i)
	}
}

func main(){
	num := 10
	go iterateUntil(num)
	// You can use goroutines on lambda functions too
	go func(msg string) {	
		for i := 0; i < num; i++ {
			time.Sleep(500 * time.Millisecond)
			fmt.Println(msg)
		}
	}("im reading fugu.cafe")

	fmt.Println("ops")
	time.Sleep(6 * time.Second)
}
```
Look at the output:
```sh
$ go run main.go
ops
im reading fugu.cafe
0
1
im reading fugu.cafe
im reading fugu.cafe
2
3
im reading fugu.cafe
im reading fugu.cafe
4
5
im reading fugu.cafe
im reading fugu.cafe
6
7
im reading fugu.cafe
im reading fugu.cafe
8
im reading fugu.cafe
9
```

Notice how the goroutines make progress together, although they aren't synchronized. This is concurrency.

### Channels

Channels are typed pipes used to send and receive values between goroutines. While a value isn't received, the sending goroutine blocks until the other goroutine receives it and vice-versa.
This built-in blocking behavior makes channels a natural way to synchronize execution between goroutines. Depending on the use case, you can use channels to coordinate task completion, pass data safely, or control the timing of concurrent tasks.

A brief example:
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func iterateUntil(
	num int,
	myTurn <-chan struct{}, // For receive-only, use <- prefix, otherwise, <- suffix 
	yourTurn chan<- struct{},
	done chan<- string,
	id string,
) {
	for i := 0; i < num; i++ {
		<-myTurn
		if id == "i" {
			fmt.Println(i)
		} else {
			fmt.Println("im reading fugu.cafe")
		}
		yourTurn <- struct{}{}
	}
	done <- "OK!" 
}

func main() {
	num := 10

	// For signals that dont need to carry data, use a channel of empty structs
	chanX := make(chan struct{})
	chanY := make(chan struct{})
	done := make(chan string, 2) // we can define the length of a channel

	go iterateUntil(num, chanX, chanY, done, "i")
	go iterateUntil(num, chanY, chanX, done, "msg")

	fmt.Println("there is")

	chanX <- struct{}{} // init

	fmt.Println(<-done)
	_ = <-chanX // throw away the last turn signal
	fmt.Println(<-done)

	fmt.Println("all done")
}
```
Look at the output:
```sh
$ go run main.go 
there is
0
im reading fugu.cafe
1
im reading fugu.cafe
2
im reading fugu.cafe
3
im reading fugu.cafe
4
im reading fugu.cafe
5
im reading fugu.cafe
6
im reading fugu.cafe
7
im reading fugu.cafe
8
im reading fugu.cafe
9
OK!
im reading fugu.cafe
OK!
all done
```

Notice how it's synchronized, but there are some problems. It can be difficult to organize the synchrony between different or large quantity of functions.

### "sync" package

While channels are the idiomatic way to communicate and synchronize between goroutines, sometimes you need more direct control or a simpler way to manage synchrony goroutines without worrying too much about deadlocking or data racing. The "sync" package offers that, check [sync](https://pkg.go.dev/sync) for more options.

Here is the same example as before, but, utilizing Mutex, WaitGroup and Cond:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
)

func iterateUntil(
	num int,
	mu *sync.Mutex,
	cond *sync.Cond,
	wg *sync.WaitGroup,
	turn *string,
	id string) {
	defer wg.Done()

	for i := 0; i < num; i++ {
		// acquire lock
		mu.Lock()
		// unlock to receive turn
		for *turn != id {
			cond.Wait()
		}
		if id == "i" {
			fmt.Println(i)
			*turn = "msg"
		} else {
			fmt.Println("im reading fugu.cafe")
			*turn = "i"
		}
		// For more than 2 goroutines being used, use Broadcast()!!!
		cond.Signal()
		// Unlock
		mu.Unlock()
	}
}

func main() {
	var wg sync.WaitGroup
	var mu sync.Mutex
	cond := sync.NewCond(&mu)

	wg.Add(2) // 2 is the number of goroutines for waitgroup

	fmt.Println("there is")

	turn := "i" // start

	go iterateUntil(10, &mu, cond, &wg, &turn, "i")
	go iterateUntil(10, &mu, cond, &wg, &turn, "msg")

	wg.Wait() // Wait until all goroutines finishes
	fmt.Println("both OK!")
	fmt.Println("all done")
}
```
Look at the output:
```sh
$ go run main.go  
there is
0
im reading fugu.cafe
1
im reading fugu.cafe
2
im reading fugu.cafe
3
im reading fugu.cafe
4
im reading fugu.cafe
5
im reading fugu.cafe
6
im reading fugu.cafe
7
im reading fugu.cafe
8
im reading fugu.cafe
9
im reading fugu.cafe
both OK!
all done
Î» $ 
```


Notice how the sync package makes concurrency easier to manage, although channels are often enough for many cases.
Not only that, "sync" provides the subpackage "atomic", which is useful for performing atomic operations and avoiding data racing in shared memory access and mutation.

A brief example of "sync/atomic" package, check [sync/atomic](https://pkg.go.dev/sync/atomic) for more options:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
	"sync/atomic"
)

func main() {
	var counter int64
	var wg sync.WaitGroup
	workers := 5
	increments := 1000

	wg.Add(workers)

	for i := 0; i < workers; i++ {
		go func() {
			defer wg.Done()
			for j := 0; j < increments; j++ {
				// prevents data racing between goroutines 
				atomic.AddInt64(&counter, 1)
			}
		}()
	}

	wg.Wait()
	fmt.Println("final value:", counter)
}
```
Look at the output:
```sh
$ go run main.go  
final value: 5000
```
